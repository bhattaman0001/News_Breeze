# Built with üõ†

- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - First class and official programming language for Android development.
- [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) - For asynchronous calls and tasks to utilize threads.
- [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) - Collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps.
  - [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) - Data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.
  - [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on UI changes.
  - [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) - Room is an Android library which is an ORM that wraps Android's native SQLite database.
  - [StateFlow and SharedFlow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow/stateflow-and-sharedflow#:~:text=StateFlow%20is%20a%20state%2Dholder,property%20of%20the%20MutableStateFlow%20class.) - StateFlow and SharedFlow are Flow APIs that enable flows to optimally emit state updates and emit values to multiple consumers.
  - Third party libraries like [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/), [Glide](https://bumptech.github.io/glide/int/volley.html).

# Architecture üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
This app uses [MVVM(Model View View-Model)](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture#recommended-app-arch) architecture.

 * Third party libraries like [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/), [Glide](https://bumptech.github.io/glide/int/volley.html).
 
 # Why Retrofit?
 * Retrofit is type-safe REST client for Android and Java which aims to make it easier to consume RESTful web services.
 
 # What is Room?
 * Room is an ORM, Object Relational Mapping library. In other words, Room will map our database objects to Java objects. Room provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
